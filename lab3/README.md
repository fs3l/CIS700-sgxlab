In this lab, you are given the initial state that a custom Blockchain network of several miners is hosted on a single machine on campus which keeps running for several days. The Blockchain machine also runs a daemon that perdically instructs some miner to conduct transactions with other miners.

To start with, you will be given instructions to join our on-campus Blockchain network. The instructions are in [[JoinBlockchain.md](lab3/JoinBlockchain.md)]

Then, the lab requires you to design Ethereum scripts to complete the following three tasks. 
1) Show the coins mined. 2) Show Blockchain and how it is extended over time. 3) Submit a transaction to the Blockchain, and show (whether) it is included in the Blockchain after 5/10/30 minutes.

Etheurem commands (with the go-etheurem client) can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Management-APIs).

More details will be posted.
